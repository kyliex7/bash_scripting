### 1. make a basic bash script for printing message based on what's users favourite color. (make sure you handle
###    the default case to something)
####     example:
            ```
            $ ./color_script
            Enter your favourite color: blue
            You chose blue! a nice and charming color.
            ```

### 2. make a script that exits with the user provided exitcode.
####    example:
```
            $ ./exit_script
            Enter the exitcode: 9
            exiting the script...
            $ echo $?
            9
```
