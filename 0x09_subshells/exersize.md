### 1. create a script that runs parallel tasks where each process runs on a subshell.
####    example:
```
        $ ./parallel_subshell
        starting parallel tasks...
        start time: 21:56:54
        task 1 completed after 2 seconds.
        task 2 completed after 3 seconds.
        end time: 21:56:57
        all tasks finished!
```
